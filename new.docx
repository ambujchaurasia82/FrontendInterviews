what is output
const arr = [10, 12, 15, 21];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
setTimeout(function() {
console.log(`index: ${i}, element: ${arr[i]}`)
}, 3000);
}
Output is  index : 4, element : undefined
	
Change method as per closure	
const arr = [10, 12, 15, 21];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
setTimeout(function() {
console.log(`index: ${i}, element: ${arr[i]}`)
}, 3000);
}
Ans: function arr2() {
for(let i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
console.log(`index ` + i )
}
 function arr3(){
for(let i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
console.log(`element ` + arr[i] )
}
}
arr3();
}
	arr2();
